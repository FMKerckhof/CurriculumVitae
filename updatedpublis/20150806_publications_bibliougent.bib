  abstract     = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are complex multifactorial diseases characterized by an inappropriate host response to an altered commensal microbiome and dysfunctional mucus barrier. Cigarette smoking is the best known environmental risk factor in IBD. Here, we studied the influence of chronic smoke exposure on the gut microbiome and mucus layer composition in conventional mice. We compared smoke-exposed to air-exposed mice (n = 12) after a smoke exposure of 24 weeks. Both Illumina sequencing (n = 6) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (n = 12) showed that bacterial activity and community structure were significantly altered in the colon due to smoke exposure. Interestingly, an increase of Lachnospiraceae sp. activity in the colon was observed. Also, changes in the mRNA expression Muc2 and Muc3 increased in the ileum, whereas Muc4 increased in the distal colon of smoke-exposed mice (n = 6). Furthermore, we observed increased Cxcl2 and decreased Ifn-\ensuremath{\gamma} in the ileum, and increased Il-6 and decreased Tgf-\ensuremath{\beta} in the proximal colon. Tight junction gene expression remained unchanged. We infer that the modulating role of chronic smoke exposure as a latently present risk factor in the gut may be driven by the altered epithelial mucus profiles and changes in microbiome composition and immune factors.},

  abstract     = {Methane-oxidizing cultures from five different inocula were enriched to be used for co-metabolic degradation of micropollutants. In a first screening, 18 different compounds were tested for degradation with the cultures as well as with four pure methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) strains. The tested compounds included pharmaceuticals, chemical additives, pesticides, and their degradation products. All enriched cultures were successful in the degradation of at least four different pollutants, but the compounds degraded most often were sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and benzotriazole (BTZ). Addition of acetylene, a specific methane monooxygenase (MMO) inhibitor, revealed that SMX and BTZ were mainly degraded co-metabolically by the present MOB. The pure MOB cultures exhibited less degradation potential, while SMX and BTZ were also degraded by three of the four tested pure strains. For MOB, copper (Cu2+) concentration is often an important factor, as several species have the ability to express a soluble MMO (sMMO) if the Cu2+ concentration is low. In literature, this enzyme is often described to have a broader compound range for co-metabolic degradation of pollutants, in particular when it comes to aromatic structures. However, this study indicated that co-metabolic degradation of the aromatic compounds SMX and BTZ was possible at high Cu2+ concentration, most probably catalyzed by pMMO.},

  abstract     = {Deep-sea life is featured by extreme environmental conditions, such as low temperature, limitation in nutrients and carbon sources, and high hydrostatic pressure (Jannasch, 1979). As a consequence, marine microbial communities have incredibly broadened their metabolic versatility to make efficient use of any resource available (Sibuet and Karine, 1998). In the present work, we collected deep-sea microbial communities (1km, equivalent to 100bars) and grew them using long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Because of their solid nature at ambient temperature and pressure, such hydrocarbons have a higher chance to sink to the seafloor during spills with respect to gaseous or liquid, short-chained ones. Hence, our hypothesis was that the use of long-chain alkanes as unique carbon sources at high hydrostatic pressure would have resulted into microbial communities enriched in piezophiles, i.e., bacteria growing better at high pressure rather than at atmospheric ones. Nevertheless, high hydrostatic pressure does not improve much the solubility of these compounds in water (Brunner, 1990), the bioavailability of which remains always extremely low. This condition is ideal to test the flexibility of piezophiles and address some of the basic questions regarding their metabolism. In particular, in these bacteria any biomolecule (enzymes, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.) must be adapted to properly function under high pressure. Hence, the range of reaction conditions suitable for biocatalysis in these microbes is supposed to be larger than for bacteria growing in surface waters.
Deep-sea samples (1km, 100bars) were incubated at three different pressure conditions (1, 100 and 200bars) using either icosane (C20) or triacontane (C30). In particular, these three pressure conditions were selected in order to separately enrich piezotolerant bacteria (growing well at both 1 and 100bars) from piezophiles (growing better at 100 and 200bars). High-pressure reactors were inoculated with the same initial environmental microbial community and run for 9 consecutive incubation periods, each of which lasted 10d. At the end of any incubation, aliquots of growing bacterial cells were transferred to a new reactor, for a total of 90d of enrichment. Experiments were followed according to pH, O2 consumption, optical density, phosphates and sulphates consumption, hydrophobicity, cell number by flow cytometry and hydrocarbon solubility in the water phase. Furthermore, characterization of the microbial community shift was conducted through both DGGE and high throughput sequencing using Illumina platform.
In each culture condition, marine bacteria were able to grow by taking up C20 and C30. Respiration rates were always high, and production of surfactants occurred particularly at 1bar. This is probably due to the fact that a higher number of cells was noted at 1bar than at higher pressures, when filtering with 25\ensuremath{\mu}m. However, numerous bacterial populations smaller than 1.5\ensuremath{\mu}m were noted in all conditions. Hydrophobicity, i.e., the capability to move towards oil droplets, was generally high in all conditions. Phosphates and sulphates consumption was statistically different according to the pressure applied and/or O2 availability. Future work will be devoted to the understanding of specific enzymatic activity (through meta-proteomics) and to the characterization of the biomass features in terms of PLFAs, wax, esters and lipids.},

These textiles are not sterile and can harbor high bacterial counts as sweat and bacteria are transmitted from the skin. We investigated the microbial growth and odor development in cotton and synthetic clothing fabrics. T-shirts were collected from 26 healthy individuals after an intensive bicycle spinning session and incubated for 28 h before analysis. A trained odor panel determined significant differences between polyester versus cotton fabrics for the hedonic value, the intensity, and five qualitative odor characteristics. The polyester T-shirts smelled significantly less pleasant and more intense, compared to the cotton T-shirts. A dissimilar bacterial growth was found in cotton versus synthetic clothing textiles. Micrococci were isolated in almost all synthetic shirts and were detected almost solely on synthetic shirts by means of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting. A selective enrichment of micrococci in an in vitro growth experiment confirmed the presence of these species on polyester. Staphylococci were abundant on both cotton and synthetic fabrics. Corynebacteria were not enriched on any textile type. This research found that the composition of clothing fibers promotes differential growth of textile microbes and, as such, determines possible malodor generation.},

  abstract     = {Crosstalk between the human host and its microbiota is reported to influence various diseases such as mucositis. Fundamental research in this area is however complicated by the time frame restrictions during which host-microbe interactions can be studied in vitro. The model proposed in this paper, consisting of an oral epithelium and biofilm, can be used to study microbe-host crosstalk in vitro in non-infectious conditions up to 72 h. Microbiota derived from oral swabs were cultured on an agar/mucin layer and challenged with monolayers of keratinocytes grown on plastic or collagen type I layers embedded with fibroblasts. The overall microbial biofilm composition in terms of diversity remained representative for the oral microbiome, whilst the epithelial cell morphology and viability were unaffected. Applying the model to investigate wound healing revealed a reduced healing of 30 \% in the presence of microbiota, which was not caused by a reduction of the proliferation index (52.1-61.5) or a significantly increased number of apoptotic (1-1.13) or necrotic (32-30.5 \%) cells. Since the model allows the separate study of the microbial and cellular exometabolome, the biofilm and epithelial characteristics after co-culturing, it is applicable for investigations within fundamental research and for the discovery and development of agents that promote wound healing.},

  abstract     = {The use of mixed microbial communities (microbiomes) for biotechnological applications has steadily increased over the past decades. However, these microbiomes are not readily available from public culture collections, hampering their potential for widespread use. The main reason for this lack of availability is the lack of an effective cryopreservation protocol. Due to this critical need, we evaluated the functionality as well as the community structure of three different types of microbiomes before and after cryopreservation with two cryoprotective agents (CPA). Microbiomes were selected based upon relevance towards applications: (1) a methanotrophic co-culture (MOB), with potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollutants removal and bioplastics production; (2) an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) biofilm, with enhanced economic and ecological benefits for wastewater treatment, and (3) fecal material from a human donor, with potential applications for fecal transplants and pre/probiotics research. After three months of cryopreservation at -80 degrees C, we found that metabolic activity, in terms of the specific activity recovery of MOB, aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) and anaerobic AOB (AnAOB, anammox) in the OLAND mixed culture, resumes sooner when one of our selected CPA [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO plus trehalose and tryptic soy broth (DMSO+TT)] was added. However, the activity of the fecal community was not influenced by the CPA addition, although the preservation of the community structure (as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing) was enhanced by addition of CPA. In summary, we have evaluated a cryopreservation protocol that succeeded in preserving both community structure and functionality of value-added microbiomes. This will allow individual laboratories and culture collections to boost the use of microbiomes in biotechnological applications.},

A profound view was obtained of the interpersonal, intrapersonal and temporal diversity of the human axillary microbiota. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and next generation sequencing on 16S rRNA gene region were combined and used as extent to each other. Two important clusters were characterized, where Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species were the abundant species. Females predominantly clustered within the Staphylococcus cluster (87\%, n = 17), whereas males clustered more in the Corynebacterium cluster (39\%, n = 36). The axillary microbiota was unique to each individual. Left-right asymmetry occurred in about half of the human population. For the first time, an elaborate study was performed on the dynamics of the axillary microbiome. A relatively stable axillary microbiome was noticed, although a few subjects evolved towards another stable community. The deodorant usage had a proportional linear influence on the species diversity of the axillary microbiome.},

MOB subgroups have different responses to key environmental controls, reflecting on their functional traits. Their unique features (C1-metabolism, unique lipids and congruence between the 16S rRNA and pmoA gene phylogeny) have facilitated numerous environmental studies, which in combination with the availability of cultured representatives, yield the most comprehensive ecological picture of any known microbial functional guild. Here, we focus on the broad MOB subgroups (type I and type II MOB), and aim to conceptualize MOB functional traits and observational characteristics derived primarily from these environmental studies to be interpreted as microbial life strategies. We focus on the functional traits, and the conditions under which these traits will render different MOB subgroups a selective advantage. We hypothesize that type I and type II MOB generally have distinct life strategies, enabling them to predominate under different conditions and maintain functionality. The ecological characteristics implicated in their adopted life strategies are discussed, and incorporated into the Competitor-Stress tolerator-Ruderal functional classification framework as put forward for plant communities. In this context, type I MOB can broadly be classified as competitor-ruderal while type II MOB fit more within the stress tolerator categories. Finally, we provide an outlook on MOB applications by exemplifying two approaches where their inferred life strategies could be exploited thereby, putting MOB into the context of microbial resource management.},

The presence of Aloe vera gel powder and algae extract in product B as compared to the standard blend (product A) improved its fermentation along the entire simulated colon. The potential extended effect of product B in the simulated distal colon, as compared to product A, was confirmed by: (i) the separate clustering of the samples before and after the treatment in the phylogenetic-based dendrogram and OTU-based PCoA plot only for product B; (ii) a higher richness estimator (+33 vs. -36 \% of product A); and (iii) a higher dynamic parameter (21 vs. 13 \%). These data show that the combination of well designed in vitro simulators with barcoded pyrosequencing is a powerful tool for characterizing changes occurring in the gut microbiota following a treatment. However, for the quantification of low-abundance species-of interest because of their relationship to potential positive health effects (i.e. bifidobacteria or lactobacilli)-conventional molecular ecological approaches, such as PCR-DGGE and qPCR, still remain a very useful complementary tool.},

  abstract     = {Biogas produced by anaerobic digestion is typically converted into electricity and low value heat. In this study, biogas is microbially transformed into valuable bioproducts. As proof of principle, the production of feed additives, i.e. lipids and polyhydroxybutyrate, out of biogas was evaluated. In a first stage, the CO2 in a synthetic biogas was photosynthetically fixed by an algae Scenedesmus sp. culture at an average rate of 192 +/- 9 mg CO2 L-1 liquid d(-1), resulting in concomitant O-2 production. After N-depletion, more than 30\% of the 220 +/- 7 mg lipids g(-1) total organic carbon were unsaturated. In a second stage, the theoretical resulting gas mixture of 60\% CH4 and 40\% O-2 was treated by a methane oxidizing Methylocystis parvus culture, with oxidation rates up to 452 +/- 7 mg(-1) CH4-C L-1 liquid d(-1). By repeated N-limitation, concentrations of 295 +/- 50 mg intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate g(-1) cell dry weight were achieved. Finally, a one-stage approach with controlled coculturing of both microbial groups resulted in harvestable bioflocs. This is the first time that a total microbial conversion of both greenhouse gases into biomass was achieved without external O-2 provision. Based on these results, a biotechnological approach is discussed whereby all kinds of biogas can be transformed into valuable bioproducts.},

  abstract     = {Pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics are rapidly emerging, entailing important consequences for human health. This study investigated if the broad-host-range multiresistance plasmid pB10, isolated from a wastewater treatment plant, harbouring amoxicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance genes, was transferable to the foodborne pathogens Salmonella spp. or E. coli O157:H7 and how this transfer alters the phenotype of the recipients. The transfer ratio was determined by both plating and flow cytometry. Antibiotic resistance profiles were determined for both recipients and transconjugants using the disk diffusion method. For 14 of the 15 recipient strains, transconjugants were detected. Based on plating, transfer ratios were between 6.8 x 10(-9) and 3.0 x 10(-2) while using flow cytometry, transfer ratios were between {\textlangle}1.0 x 10(-5) and 1.9 x 10(-2). With a few exceptions, the transconjugants showed phenotypically increased resistance, indicating that most of the transferred resistance genes were expressed. In summary, we showed that an environmental plasmid can be transferred into foodborne pathogenic bacteria at high transfer ratios. However, the transfer ratio seemed to be recipient strain dependent. Moreover, the newly acquired resistance genes could turn antibiotic susceptible strains into resistant ones, paving the way to compromise human health.},

  abstract     = {Background: 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) based PCR followed by sequencing of these PCR fragments is the preferred method of quantifying prokaryotic microbial communities. Limitations of the sequencing technology (mainly the throughput) were until recently the limiting factor to quantify and compare large amounts of different samples or communities. However, recent developments in high-throughput sequencing techniques allow easier quantification of microbial communities and have led to a spectacular increase of insights into the composition and functionalities of microbial communities.
The development of these recent sequencing techniques went hand in hand with the development of new analysis tools. In the last couple of years, several tools such as MOTHUR, PyroNoise/AmpliconNoise , VITCOMIC and Qiime have been developed to analyse pyrosequencing data sets and to assess microbial diversity.
Methods: PROKAR-SEQ is a modular framework consisting of several different modules, which uses a MySQL database to retrieve raw data, to store intermediary data, and to store final analysis results. Final results are visualized by the visualization module, which fetches all required data from the database as well. Sequences are processed using AmpliconNoise and mapped onto the reference using BWA-SW. 16S rDNA reference sequences where downloaded from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) website. A complete taxonomic overview of all prokaryotes present in RDP was downloaded from the RDP website. Each taxonomic entry is quantified (using a custom perl pipeline) on each taxonomic level (fylum, order, genus{\textellipsis}). An interactive interface was made using HTML/PHP and the Google Maps API. The web-based toolkit includes a prokaryote taxonomical browser, a geographical visualisation tool and various graphing tools.
Results: For a user-selected taxonomic clade (domain, phylum, class, order, family or genus according to RDP), the relative frequency in each sample is visually depicted by a circle on the geographic location of the sample. For each sample, the rRNA content is visualized with a chart depicting the relative abundance of the selected taxonomic group from high to low. Thus users can compare different samples with each other (on the required taxonomic level) or analyze the composition of a single sample in detail.
Conclusions: We developed PROCAR-SEQ, a tool to quantify and visualize microbial communities using GS-FLX next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. An example of the possibilities is available at http://athos.ugent.be/metagenom-x?p=map\_test.},
